Nakul wants to know the minimum number of moves a knight takes to reach from one square to another square of a chess board (8X8). Nakul is brilliant and he had already written a program to solve the problem. Nakul wants to know whether Anjali can do it. Anjali is very weak in programming. Help her to solve the problem.\n",
